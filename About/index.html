 	<body>
 		I am a physics and computer science student at the University of British Columbia with a massive range of interests including quantum computing, philosophy, 
 		jazz, ultimate frisbee, and chess. I would love to build a chess engine, and eventually write software to run a chess engine on a quantum computer. If you would 
		like to check out some of my projects please look into my GitHub or resume for more information. I am particularly proud of having made an AM radio receiver
		in one of my physics labs and a chess software over the course of one of my computer science classes. I have experiencing at one of the worlds largest particle
		physics research facilities at TRIUMF as a first year student and aspire to continue on a path of research to further contribute to the scientific community!
